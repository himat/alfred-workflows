# Clipboard snippets 

Each snippet has a different sequence of text to type to activate it.

Each snippet operates on the latest text in your clipboard, and then immediately pastes it.

Download the .alfredworkflow file and simply open it to install.

## .lower: All text to lowercase 
## .sent: Text to sentencecase (first letter of the text is capitalized, all others to lowercase)
- Note that if you have multiple sentences in your text, this doesn't actually make each individual sentence's first letter capitalized. It only does the first letter of the entire text body.
## .title: First letter of each word is capitalized 
## .removenewlines: Replaces every newline in your text with a space
