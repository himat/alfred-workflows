# My Alfred Workflows

Each folder has an independent workflow with its own README. 
So you can download the ones that you want.

## Installation of any workflow
Each folder has a `.alfredworkflow` file that you can download directly from GitHub and which you can then just click on to let Alfred install it automatically.

### clipboard-snippets
Text manipulation snippets that manipulate your clipboard text do do things like convert to all lowercase, titlecase, remove new lines, etc.

### imgur-uploader 
Uploads the most recent clipboard item to imgur and pastes the uploaded image URL into your clipboard. It also opens the uploaded image URL in your browser.
